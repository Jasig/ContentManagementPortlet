<h3>How do I determine which type of content repository is used by the portlet ?</h3>
<p>The default configuration of the portlet uses an implementation of the Java Content Repository provided by Apache JackRabbit. 
The portlet defines a repository deployment model in the <code>"context.xml"</code> file and uses the <code>"ContentManagementPortlet-data.xml"</code> to 
configure the mapping template.</p>

<a name="locationPortletChannel"></a>
<h3>How do I determine the location of the content for my portlet channel ?</h3>
<p>By default, the portlet will write to <code>"root"</code> within the underlying configured content repository. 
To change this location, go to the Preferences page of the portlet and modify the root location for the content repository. 
The portlet will use the value assigned to this field to determine the content location in the repository. 
Please note that if you have multiple channels publishing the portlet, content will be overwritten by each portlet in turn, 
unless you specify a different value for the setting defined above.</p>

<a name="#allowContentAuthors"></a>
<h3>How do I allow content authors to publish content ?</h3>
<p>By default, the portlet defines the <code>"author"</code> role for users who are part of the <code>"local.2"</code> group. This setting is defined inside the <code>"portlet.xml"</code> file. Furthermore, the "author" role is mapped to the <code>"portletModeUserRoleAuthorizationInterceptor"</code> element defined in the <code>"ContentManagementPortlet-context.xml"</code> file.</p>

<a name="#internationalization"></a>
<h3>How do I configure the portlet for multiple languges ?</h3>
<p>Content Management Portlet uses localized resource files for internationalization of the portlet. These files are defined inside the <code>"languages"</code> folder. Once the language of the portal is switched, the portlet will automatically load the correct language file for text and error messages.

<ul type="square">
<li><b><code>messages_COUNTRYCODE.properties:</code></b> defines localized text, such as button captions, for the specific country code configured by the portal.</li>
<li><b><code>errors_COUNTRYCODE.properties":</code></b> defines localized text for error messages, for the specific country code configured by the portal.</li>
</ul>

If a language file is not available for the specific country code set by the portal, the portlet will choose English as the default language. 

Please note that:

<ul type="square">
<li>There's no additional configuration for the localization of the editor. The editor will automatically detect the language code and change accordingly.</li>
<li>Portlet Help mode will load a file inside the <code>"help"</code> directory based on the portal language. The name of the help file is consistent with the language country code.</li>
</ul>

<a name="#contentValidation"></a>
<h3>How do I configure the portlet to allow content validation before submission ?</h3>
<p>By default, the portlet scans the submitted content for cross-site security issues  using the OWASP AntiSamy package. Issues are reported back to the user and submission is cancelled if any are found. To change this behavior,
go to the Preferences page of the portlet and add/modify the setting for XSS validation. The portlet will use the value assigned to this field to determine whether or not content should be scanned. 

If you wish to alter the rules that define cross-site scripting vulnerabilities for the portlet, please adjust the rules defined in the <code>"antiSammyPolicy.xml"</code> file.

<a name="#numberOfAttachments"></a>
<h3>How do I configure the number of allowed attachments for a post ?</h3>
<p>The default number of attachments allowed for each post is <code>2</code>. To change this value, go to the Preferences page of the portlet and add/modify the setting for number of post attachments allowed. The portlet will use the value assigned to this field to determine the number of attachments allowed.
</p>

<br/><br/>

<a name="#portletTheme"></a>
<h3>How do I configure the portlet theme and style ?</h3>
<p>The portlet uses numerous CSS files in conjunction with the <a href='http://jquery.com'>jQuery Javascript</a> library to theme the user interface. These files are located in <code>“javascript\jquery\css”</code> folder of the application. The jQuery UI theme by default is set to be the Redmond theme, <a href='http://jqueryui.com/themeroller'>available here</a> as part of the default theme gallery provided by jQueryand is placed inside the folder by the same name. You could of course use the jQuery theme builder yourself to create your own custom style.

<a name="#schedulerInterval"></a>
<h3>How often does the scheduler engine run to publish posts ?</h3>
<p>The scheduler interval settings are placed inside the <code>ContentManagementPortlet-quartz.xml</code> file. See the values for <code>repeatInterval</code> and <code>startDelay</code> for better details.
